name: product-demand-research
description: When the user wants to know whether people actually have the problem a product idea solves — what they complain about, what they ask for, what they use instead, and the words they use for it — drawn from public discussion on Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, Hacker-News-style forums and Chinese Q&A platforms. Also use when the user mentions "validate this idea", "is there demand for", "pain points in", "voice of customer", "what do people say about this problem", "objections to", "what are people using instead", or "find the language customers use". Input is the product idea or category; output is an evidence-backed demand read with every quoted post linked. Runs on Glasser (paid per call). For what is trending rather than what hurts, see social-trends. For a named competitor's ads, see ad-intelligence.

# Product demand research

This skill requires Glasser — one Key across many paid data providers. Install it first: https://glasser.ai/SKILL.md?utm_source=glasser-skills&utm_medium=skill covers installation and use.

Use Glasser for all data acquisition here. Reach for another tool only when the Glasser catalog has no endpoint for what is needed.

## Inputs

- the product idea or category, stated as the problem it solves and for whom
- the market — country and language; it decides the platforms and the communities to search

## Process

### 1. Turn the idea into the words people use

The idea is stated in the builder's language; the evidence is in the buyer's. Write the searches as the complaint, the question, or the workaround people would post — "how do you manage X", "I lost money when Y", "is there a tool that Z", "fine until it breaks" — plus the names of the things they use today and the category terms adjacent to it. Draft several phrasings per pain; the first phrasing rarely matches how the community talks.

Pick the communities where this buyer actually posts: the subreddits, the forums, the Q&A sites, the video channels. A narrow community that matches the buyer beats a broad one that matches the keyword.

### 2. Find the threads, in parallel

Every search stands alone; fan out across queries, platforms and communities.

- forum and community search on each phrasing, sorted by relevance within a window — sorting by popularity returns the platform's viral posts, not the ones about the problem
- community-scoped search inside the chosen subreddits and forums
- video search for reviews, tutorials and "how I built" content on the category
- Q&A and discussion platforms in the market's language

Rank candidate threads by comment count and specificity of the title, not by upvotes. The threads that carry the language are usually small — single-digit upvotes, dozens of replies — because they are questions, not announcements.

### 3. Pull the conversations, in parallel per thread

For each shortlisted thread: the original post and the comments, ordered by score, with author, date and link kept on every one. For videos: the comments, and the transcript when the video is a builder or founder describing the problem — a competitor's launch pitch is a free sample of how they frame the pain. Drop moderator notices, deleted content and spam; keep slang, misspellings and emotion, since that is the language being collected.

### 4. Classify and cluster

Sort every useful comment into one of: complaint or pain, question, workaround in use, alternative named, objection to existing solutions, buying intent or willingness to pay, feature request, praise, disagreement. Then cluster by the underlying problem. A cluster is real when it appears across more than one thread and more than one author; a single vivid comment is an example, not a signal. Score each cluster by frequency, intensity of language, recency, and whether anyone mentions paying.

Note who is speaking. Vendor employees post in these threads and often disclose it; their comments are competitor discovery and are marked as such, not counted as demand.

### 5. Read the evidence against the idea

For each pain cluster: does the idea address it, partly, or not at all. List the alternatives people already use and what they say is wrong with them — that is the switching cost. List the objections that would apply to the idea as stated, in the words used. Record where nobody asks for the idea by name even though the pain is present; that gap is a finding about positioning, not absence of demand. Keep exact quotes for anything that would go into copy.

## Dimensions and where to look

The middle column is a search query, not a provider name — search the catalog rather than assume what it offers.

| Dimension | What to pull | Search the catalog for | Confirm in `inspect` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Forum search** | threads matching a phrasing, with title, community, score, comment count, date, link | `reddit search posts`, `forum search` | sort options — relevance versus top; time window filter; page size |
| **Community-scoped search** | threads inside a named community | `reddit subreddit search` | whether a query is applied or only the community's top posts return |
| **Thread comments** | original post and comments with score, author, date, replies | `reddit post comments` | whether replies are nested or flat; pagination; the identifier it takes — URL or ID |
| **Video search** | videos on the category with views, date, channel, link | `youtube search`, `tiktok search keyword`, `bilibili search` | region and language parameters; sort and date filters — accepted values are enumerated |
| **Video comments** | comments with likes, ordered | `youtube video comments`, `tiktok video comments` | the response shape and the field carrying the text; ordering options |
| **Video transcript** | spoken text of a video | `youtube video transcript`, `tiktok video transcript` | language parameter; whether a missing transcript is charged |
| **Q&A platforms** | questions and answers on the category | `zhihu search`, `quora search`, `stackexchange search` | which platforms the market needs; language |
| **Review sites** | complaints and praise on existing alternatives | `product reviews`, `app store reviews`, `trustpilot reviews` | per-review or per-query pricing; sort by rating |

## Report format

One read per idea. **Every quote carries its link**; a pain without a linked thread is not evidence. Quotes are verbatim, not paraphrased.

```markdown
# Demand research — [idea]

**Stated as**: [the problem, for whom] · **Market**: [country / language] · **Captured**: [date]
**Evidence**: [n] threads across [communities], [n] comments read, window [dates]

## Verdict
Demand signal: strong / medium / weak, with the two or three clusters that drive it.
Whether people ask for this solution by name, or only for the problem.
Confidence: high / medium / low, and why — number of threads, spread of communities, recency.

## Pain clusters
### [Cluster], [n] threads · [n] authors
What is said, in two or three lines. Then the quotes:
> "…" — [community, comment count](link)
> "…" — [community](link)
Intensity, recency, and any mention of paying.

## Alternatives in use
| Alternative | What it is used for | What people say is wrong with it | Link |
|---|---|---|---|

## Objections the idea would meet
| Objection | In their words | Link | Applies to the idea as stated |
|---|---|---|---|

## Buying intent and willingness to pay
Quotes that name a price, a budget, or a purchase decision, with links.

## Language to reuse
Exact phrases, each with its link, grouped by the cluster they belong to.

## Competitors surfaced
Products named in the threads, and vendor employees who posted — with their disclosure.

## Where the idea lands
| Pain cluster | Addressed by the idea | Gap |
|---|---|---|

## Coverage & sources
| Platform | Queries | Threads found | Threads read | Provider / endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Platforms or communities searched that returned nothing relevant, and why.
