name: investor-diligence
description: When an investor wants to research a company before putting money in — who runs it, how it is funded, whether the traction is real, what the risks are, and what has changed recently. Also use when the user mentions "due diligence", "diligence on", "verify this company", "background on this company before the call", "deal memo", "diligence memo", or "what do we know about [company]". Input is one or more company names or domains; output is a diligence memo per company and, for several, a comparison. Runs on Glasser (paid per call). For a scored investment read with a verdict rather than a verification memo, see startup-analysis. For researching rivals to the user's own product, see competitor-research.

# Investor diligence

This skill requires Glasser — one Key across many paid data providers. Install it first: https://glasser.ai/SKILL.md?utm_source=glasser-skills&utm_medium=skill covers installation and use.

Use Glasser for all data acquisition here. Reach for another tool only when the Glasser catalog has no endpoint for what is needed.

## Inputs

- the companies, by name or domain
- the question behind the diligence, if there is one — is the traction real, is the team credible, is the round priced right, is there a reason to walk away. It decides which dimensions go deep; with no question, the core set is the default.
- the stage, if known (pre-seed through growth, or listed). Stage changes what a normal funding gap, headcount, or traffic figure looks like.

## Process

### 1. Resolve each company to one entity

For each name, establish the canonical domain, the legal entity and its jurisdiction, and whether it is independent, a subsidiary, a rebrand, or an acquired product. Names collide; do not guess between genuinely ambiguous candidates — every later call keys off this.

### 2. Choose the dimensions

Cost is companies x dimensions, so do not run everything by default:

- **Core** — business and product, funding and investors, team and founders, traction, legal and regulatory, history. What any memo needs.
- **On request** — hiring, traffic, reputation, network, market, public filings. Run when the question calls for them; public filings only when the company is listed.

### 3. Collect, in parallel

Only step 1 is a dependency. Past it every company-and-dimension pair stands alone, so fan out as wide as the environment allows.

Settle the endpoint and its parameters once per dimension and apply the same choice to every company; different sources or limits make results incomparable.

Pull time ranges, not snapshots, wherever the endpoint allows — a funding gap that is lengthening, hiring that has stalled, or executives leaving in succession says more than any current figure.

If a dimension has no endpoint, or is priced beyond what the user agreed to, record it as missing and move on — never fill a gap from memory. An empty result is not a gap; no litigation on record, no funding disclosed, each is a finding in its own right. A company with almost no public footprint is a finding too.

## Dimensions and where to look

The middle column is a search query, not a provider name — search the catalog rather than assume what it offers.

| Dimension | What to pull | Search the catalog for | Confirm in `inspect` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Identity** | canonical domain, legal entity, jurisdiction, corporate structure | `company search by name`, `company enrichment domain` | whether an empty result is free; whether it is priced per lookup |
| **Business & product** | what they sell, to whom, pricing, integrations — from their own pages | `webpage scrape markdown` | per-page pricing; surcharge for JS rendering; whether a failed fetch is charged |
| **Funding & investors** | rounds, dates, amounts, lead and participating investors, total raised, time since last round | `company enrichment funding`, `funding rounds company` | as-of date; whether undisclosed rounds return empty and whether that is free |
| **Team & founders** | founders and executives, prior companies and roles, tenure, recent arrivals and departures | `person search company`, `person enrichment`, `company employees` | priced per person or per query; the cap on results; how recent the employment data is |
| **Traction** | named customers, case studies, review counts and ratings, app or marketplace rankings, traffic trend | `company reviews ratings`, `webpage scrape markdown`, `website traffic analytics` | traffic is usually the most expensive row — price it first; whether figures are measured or modelled |
| **Hiring** | open roles by function and location, volume over time | `job postings company`, `jobs search company` | priced per posting or per query; how far back the history goes |
| **Legal & regulatory** | litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions and watchlist hits, licences | `litigation search company`, `sanctions screening`, `news search company` | jurisdiction coverage; whether a date range changes the price |
| **Reputation** | news sentiment over the last 12 months, employee reviews, customer complaints | `news search company` over a date range, `employer reviews company` | whether a date range changes the price; per-review or per-query pricing |
| **Network** | investors, board members, partners, notable customers as a graph | `company enrichment investors`, `person enrichment board` | priced per entity or per query |
| **Market** | category, adjacent companies, how crowded the space is | `company search similar`, `company search by industry` | priced per returned row; the cap on `limit` |
| **Public filings** | annual and quarterly reports, material events, proxy — listed companies only | `sec filings company`, `regulatory filings search` | per-filing or per-query pricing; which registries are covered |
| **History** | founding, launches, renames, pivots, acquisitions, past positioning | `news search company` over a date range, plus scrapes of about / press pages | whether a date range changes the price |

## Report format

One memo per company, and a comparison when there is more than one. Keep the section order identical across memos; where a dimension was not collected, drop the section and say so under Coverage. Every claim carries its source, and inference is labelled as inference.

### Memo

```markdown
# [Company] — Diligence memo

**Domain**: [canonical domain] · **Entity**: [legal entity, jurisdiction]
**Generated**: [date] · **Depth**: [core / full] · **Stage**: [if known]
**Question**: [the question this memo answers, if one was given]

## Summary
Three to five sentences: what the company is, where it stands, the one or two
findings that matter most, and what remains unverified.

## At a glance
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Founded | |
| Headquarters | |
| Headcount | [estimate + trend] |
| Total raised | |
| Last round | [type, amount, date, lead] |
| Time since last round | |
| Est. monthly visits | [trend] |
| Open roles | |

## Business & product
What they sell, to whom, how it is priced, and how they describe themselves.

## Funding & investors
| Round | Date | Amount | Lead / notable investors |
|---|---|---|---|
Pace between rounds; investor quality; anything undisclosed.

## Team & founders
Founders and executives with background and tenure; arrivals and departures
in the last twelve months.

## Traction
Named customers, reviews, rankings, traffic trend — each marked measured or
estimated.

## Hiring
Open roles by function and location; volume over time; what the mix implies.

## Legal & regulatory
Litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or watchlist hits, licensing.

## Reputation
News sentiment over twelve months; employee and customer review themes.

## Network
Investors, board, partners, notable customers.

## Market
Category, adjacent companies, crowding.

## Public filings
Listed companies only: material items from filings, and what changed since
the prior period.

## History
Timeline — founding, launches, renames, pivots, acquisitions.

## Red flags
Each with its source and tier. Look in particular for: executives leaving
within a short window, a funding gap well beyond the stage norm, litigation or
regulatory action, sanctions hits, sustained negative coverage, claims on the
company's site that the data contradicts, and a public footprint far thinner
than the stage implies.

## Open questions
What public data could not settle and belongs in the data room or on the
founder call.

## Coverage & sources
| Dimension | Status | Provider / endpoint | As-of | Source tier | Measured or estimated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
Tier: primary (official records, filings, court records), secondary (mainstream
and trade press), tertiary (blogs, forums, reviews). Missing dimensions with
the reason: no endpoint, priced out, or empty result.
