# Amazon product opportunity scan

This skill requires Glasser — one Key across many paid data providers. Install it first: https://glasser.ai/SKILL.md covers installation and use.

Use Glasser for all data acquisition here. Reach for another tool only when the Glasser catalog has no endpoint for what is needed.

## Purpose

Identify **which product niche deserves validation** and why. A keyword's volume divided by result count is not an opportunity score. Gather independent evidence, normalize it to comparable products, assess what remains unknown, and use Jev to apply one anchored rubric. Use the `glasser` skill for current endpoint discovery, inspection, pricing, cost control, Runs and charges. For scoring, read [the Jev scorecard](references/jev-scorecard.md).

## Inputs and staged budget

Take the Amazon marketplace/language, category or reference ASIN, target buyer, proposed features/size/pack, target price, and any known unit costs. If missing, choose a clearly labeled example market and run a **preliminary scan**. Separate buyer intents rather than adding overlapping keyword volumes.

Search the live Glasser catalog and inspect each endpoint's schema, price, no-result clauses, batch size and run mode before use. Show a staged call budget and maximum charge. Reuse valid evidence already collected for the same market and date before buying it again. Start with a few keyword and listing calls; deepen only one or two promising, exact-match ASINs. A failed or timed-out Run remains in the ledger with its actual charge. Stop when the cap is reached or missing data prevents the requested conclusion.

## Process and evidence layers

| Layer | What to verify | Suitable source family |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Buyer demand | Amazon-specific keyword volume for broad, use-case and feature terms; missing terms; trend/seasonality if available | Amazon keyword data; relevant purchase-badge data as a separate lower-bound signal |
| Competition | Relevant **organic** first-page offers, brand concentration, displayed rating strength, sponsored placement, matching sizes and pack counts | Amazon ranked product search, then exact ASIN detail if needed |
| Unmet needs | Repeated specific complaints and purchase motives across distinct products, dates and rating strata | Amazon review records; ten recent reviews from one ASIN are leads, not prevalence |
| Price and commercial room | Comparable ASIN price histories, stock gaps, promotions, stable price bands, and fee context | Keepa or another inspected history source; seller fee data where available |
| Unit economics and risk | Contribution margin under base/downside price, shipping, platform fees, returns, ads, supplier feasibility and category requirements | User/supplier costs and applicable official fees; external data only when genuinely needed |

Data source names above are examples, not fixed routes. If an already-connected user source supplies a layer, use it first. Do not pay for every layer indiscriminately: expand collection when it could change the decision.

## Normalization and calculations

Save raw Runs and a normalized ledger with query, market, retrieval date, ASIN, source URL, listing type, rank, brand, material, capacity, pack count, condition, displayed price and price basis, rating scope, and missing fields. In DataForSEO Amazon results, the fields may be `data_asin`, `price_from`, `rating.votes_count`, `bought_past_month`, and `type` (`amazon_serp` versus `amazon_paid`); inspect the actual response. Keep sponsored offers separate. Exclude accessories and unrelated sizes. Compare per-unit prices only when quantity is explicit. Deduplicate child variants and do not sum parent-level review counts repeated across colors.

Amazon keyword volume is an estimated **term-level** monthly search count, not sales or category size; null means unknown. Search-result totals are not deduplicated competing SKUs. A “bought past month” figure is an Amazon-displayed **lower-bound bracket**, not exact audited sales; it can corroborate demand but cannot be divided by one keyword's searches to infer conversion.

For history, verify the returned ASIN/variant and keep one price series per comparison: Amazon retail, marketplace NEW, list price and Buy Box differ. Handle Keepa time, currency units, `-1` unavailable periods, and the 2026-02-23 definition change for NEW. A brief marketplace price spike may be seller substitution, not a durable price increase. Do not compare sales-rank numbers if their reference category IDs differ. Competitor fee estimates provide context only; calculate the candidate SKU's contribution margin from its own expected sell price, COGS, inbound freight/duties, referral and fulfillment fees, returns/warranty, discounts and ads. Unknown inputs stay unknown.

## Jev assessment and decision

After collecting a compact evidence ledger, call Jev through Glasser with the **same rubric for every candidate**. Use the [scorecard](references/jev-scorecard.md) for demand signal, competition room, differentiation evidence and overall opportunity (0–3), plus a `decision_stage` choice. Include source identity, dates, sample sizes, negative evidence and gaps in the state. Jev does not fetch or verify data; review its result against the ledger. Compute counts, price changes and margins separately with deterministic arithmetic.

Show Jev's fractional score and the most likely rubric category, but do not treat its confidence as a probability of commercial success. Enforce evidence gates after scoring: without comparable competition samples, independent pain evidence, and unit economics, the decision is at most **investigate** and the overall score is provisional. If Jev's label conflicts with a missing-evidence gate, explain the conflict and use the gate for the final recommendation. Do not average sub-scores into an opaque score or rank candidates by tiny decimal differences.

## Deliverable

Provide a dated evidence matrix by candidate: demand, comparable offers, review themes, price history, economics, source links, quality limits, Jev sub-scores and decision stage. End with one concrete next validation task per candidate and what result would change the decision. Report **every** Glasser Run used, including Jev, with status, provider response/failure, actual charge, and Run URL. A preliminary scan recommends research priorities, not inventory purchases or listing changes.
