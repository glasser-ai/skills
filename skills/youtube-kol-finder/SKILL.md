# YouTube KOL finder

This skill requires Glasser — one Key across many paid data providers. Install it first: https://glasser.ai/SKILL.md?utm_source=glasser-skills&utm_medium=skill covers installation and use.

Use Glasser for all data acquisition here. Reach for another tool only when the Glasser catalog has no endpoint for what is needed.

## Inputs

Task-specific exception: business contact lookup starts with already retrieved public material and available free public-page tools. Use Glasser contact enrichment only for unresolved channels. This exception takes precedence over the general acquisition rule above; a public email returned by a paid scraper is not a free lookup.

At least one starting point:
- product description and/or official website;
- description of the desired creators and content;
- reference channel URLs, handles, or IDs.

Selection conditions, when supplied: subscriber range, minimum average views, content language, creator location or audience geography, long-form versus Shorts, desired number of results, and excluded channels or topics. Distinguish mandatory conditions from preferences. Unspecified ranges remain open.

Contact scope: channel shortlist only or business contacts included; qualification-first or contact-first. Default to qualification-first with business contacts included. Unless specified, propose 10 qualified channels from at most 50 unique candidates, with one round of query refinement. These are visible defaults in the brief, not promises of complete coverage.

Creator fees are unknown unless a dated quote or published rate is available. Subscriber counts and views do not establish a sponsorship price.

## Process

### 1. Derive the discovery brief

Use the supplied product material and reference channels to identify the product category, user problems, intended buyers, content formats, and relevant creator archetypes. Read only the supplied sites and seed channels needed for this preparation; candidate expansion starts after step 2.

Build search themes from use cases, tutorial and review topics, category terms, and relevant competitor/product terms. Label inferred competitors as hypotheses. For reference channels, extract recurring topics and representative video formats rather than matching subscriber size alone. Translate queries into the target content language where appropriate.

Produce the Discovery brief in the report format below, including keywords, exclusions, hard filters, preferences, route, and sample definition. At least the target creator profile must be established before candidate discovery.

### 2. Establish the discovery brief

Candidate discovery requires an agreed keyword set and creator profile, including target language, hard filters, sample rule, scope, and budget. An existing confirmed brief remains valid unless its audience or hard filters materially change. Preparation and catalog inspection may precede this input; candidate expansion depends on it.

### 3. Discover and resolve channels

With the agreed brief, search the live Glasser catalog for the capabilities in the table below. Inspect the contracts: an endpoint named "channel search" may search inside a known channel rather than discover channels globally.

**Choose discovery routes by input and observed yield:**
- Primary route: derive target-language video queries from the product or seed's topics, business use cases, and demonstration style; resolve matching video authors to channels. Label this as topic-based expansion, not a provider similarity score.
- With reference channels, use related-video discovery as a complementary route. Select a pool of 2-3 representative seed videos spanning the desired use cases, then query only as many as the shared budget allows, starting with one. Retain the seed-video relationship. Related results may include the seed itself, unrelated popular videos, or a different language; they do not establish channel similarity or audience overlap.
- Global channel search is optional, useful for a known name, brand, or concise positioning term. It is not a mandatory third route. If chosen, start with a concise query; at most one refinement may use a remaining call slot. Stop if it yields no new relevant channels. Follow only returned pagination tokens; never invent a cursor or repeat empty pages.
- A connected similar-channel tool may supply candidates when permitted by the acquisition rule or explicitly requested by the user. Do not assume installation or automatically add external services.

**Keep discovery within a shared cost envelope:**
- Preserve any existing user-approved budget and cumulative spend. In the brief, separate discovery, qualification, and contact-enrichment allocations; adding a route does not enlarge any allocation or authorize more spending.
- Unless the user specifies another discovery scope, plan at most 3 paid discovery calls in total across all routes. With seeds, prefer 2 topic-video searches plus 1 related-video query; without seeds, up to 3 topic searches. These are upper limits, not required calls. Use the most relevant route first and stop early when enough candidates are available.
- Set the discovery monetary ceiling to the smaller of the available approved discovery allocation and the live inspected maximum cost of 3 comparable topic-video searches at the planned result volume. If no separate allocation exists, propose that ceiling within the approved total budget. If a replacement route cannot fit, reduce calls or skip it; do not silently raise the ceiling. This is a planning baseline, not a claim that every previous search cost that much.
- Count pagination, query refinements, format diagnostics, and new paid retries against the same call and monetary limits. Count actual unique paid calls, not repeated retrievals of one call. Reserve the inspected maximum charge of in-flight runs before dispatching more work. Budget remaining does not by itself justify spending it.
- Use the first result from each selected route to assess novel, relevant channel yield before allocating further calls. Parallel calls are allowed only when their combined reserved costs fit the envelope. Do not run all routes at full volume by default. At a limit, return the shortfall; further expansion is outside the brief unless covered by existing authorization.

Deduplicate by stable channel ID before enrichment, retaining canonical URL, aliases, discovery query, route, and seed relationship. Mark overlaps across routes and prior shortlists; exclude the seed and known channels from *new prospect* counts. Reuse dated identity, video and contact records when adequate for the current brief, refreshing only when freshness, coverage, or changed requirements demand it. If no ID can be resolved, keep identity provisional; do not merge by display name alone or pay to resolve identity already present in a returned record.

Before metric calls, use available descriptions and video evidence to screen language, subject, and demonstration style. Reject obvious mismatches early; a promising candidate with insufficient evidence stays pending. Stay within the confirmed candidate scope and shared discovery envelope. The one permitted refinement does not add calls or spending. Never relax hard filters to fill the target count.

### 4. Follow the selected route

**Qualification-first (default):** resolve identity -> assess content and filters -> retrieve contacts for qualified channels. Keep uncertain candidates in a separate review list without automatic paid contact enrichment.

**Contact-first:** resolve identity and basic topic relevance -> retrieve contacts -> perform full qualification. Keep contacts for rejected or unverified channels separate from the qualified handoff. This route changes the order of research only; it does not authorize sending messages before qualification.

Different channels can be processed independently after their identities are resolved. Reuse retrieved descriptions and video lists across qualification and contact extraction.

### 5. Qualify with comparable evidence

Assess topic fit and presentation-style fit separately: shared AI keywords are weaker evidence than comparable step-by-step builds, complete projects, and real business demonstrations. Keep adjacent-topic or broad self-improvement channels as secondary prospects even when their reach is large. Assess content fit using recent titles/descriptions and representative video links; use transcripts only when the content cannot otherwise be assessed. Explain the product-to-content connection with evidence. A search hit or a keyword in a channel name is not enough.

Choose metric sources by the fields needed, not by the discovery provider or the lowest call price alone. Prefer a single response with identity, ordered uploads, usable dates, and precise views. Do not routinely buy coarse metrics and then buy the same list again; if an observed response lacks required fields, retrieve only the necessary missing evidence within the qualification allocation. Rounded K/M counts and relative dates cannot be presented as exact comparable metrics. Localized titles, language parameters, and search-region parameters do not verify original spoken language or audience geography.

Use the user-specified view window when provided. Otherwise propose this common sample in the brief: the latest 10 eligible long-form uploads published 7 to 180 days before retrieval, excluding Shorts, live streams, and duplicates. Report arithmetic mean, median, sample size, publication range, and retrieval date. Use the same rule across candidates. For a Shorts campaign use a separate Shorts sample; never combine formats into one mean.

Mean views = sum of observed views / number of videos with observed views. A known zero is included; a missing value is not zero. Disclose missing counts and reduced samples. Fewer than 5 observed eligible videos, incomplete ordering, or unavailable upload dates makes a view-based filter unverified. For 5-9 videos label the sample reduced. Do not substitute lifetime channel views divided by all uploads for recent average views.

Classify each mandatory filter as pass, fail, or unknown. Any fail excludes the channel; any unknown leaves it pending verification. Hidden subscriber counts remain unknown. Separate creator location, content language, and audience geography: a channel's country or an English title does not establish where its viewers live.

Rank eligible channels by evidenced product/content fit, audience evidence where available, then typical recent reach and activity. Keep contact availability as a separate field. Do not call a channel fraudulent or its followers fake from weak engagement alone; describe observable anomalies and uncertainty.

### 6. Find attributable business contacts

First examine descriptions and links already obtained. With available free tools, check the channel's public business information and explicitly linked creator website, contact page, or management page. Keep the search to the channel and its linked business presence; do not guess private email addresses or bypass gated contact controls. If no free tool is available, record "free lookup unavailable" rather than "no public email".

For unresolved contacts, discover a suitable Glasser business-email capability and use identifiers established in step 3. Reuse a contact already returned by channel enrichment. A provider returning no row means unresolved, not proof that an email does not exist.

For every address preserve the source URL or provider/run provenance, retrieval date, and relationship to the channel: creator business, management/agency, or uncertain. A brand's sponsor address in a video description is not the creator's address. A shared agency address may serve several channels; retain those relationships while deduplicating the contact itself.

Keep identity attribution separate from mailbox deliverability. Publicly listed or provider-returned does not mean deliverability-verified; report verification only when evidence supports it. Conflicting addresses or weak attribution remain pending review. If no address is found, provide an attributable contact form or business profile when available.

### 7. Assemble the handoff

Return qualified creators, pending cases, and exclusions separately. For each shortlisted channel include evidence, contact provenance, and a specific partnership angle grounded in its content. Finish at the research handoff; sending, importing into outreach tools, and scheduling campaigns are separate tasks.

For each discovery route, report calls, returned records, identifiable unique channels, overlaps, new relevant candidates, channels actually qualified, and actual discovery spend. Credit a channel to its first discovery route for additive totals, retaining all secondary route evidence; channels not yet qualified are not failures. Report discovery cost per newly qualified channel and total research cost per newly qualified channel separately (zero denominator = N/A). Separate reused contacts from newly found contacts. Compare routes only with scope, query count, and qualification coverage disclosed; cheaper calls alone do not demonstrate a cheaper qualified lead.

For cost comparison, use actual run charges, including unsuccessful lookups. Report total paid research cost and contact-enrichment cost separately. Deduplicate addresses for unique-email counts and channel IDs for counts of channels with contacts. Contact-enrichment cost per unique attributable email uses only newly found unique attributable addresses from paid contact enrichment; a zero denominator is N/A. Report public contacts separately. Do not infer cost savings from a historic monthly bill without comparable volume and scope.

## Dimensions and where to look

These are capability queries, not fixed provider assignments. The public-contact row uses the exception above. Inspect results establish supported contracts, not guaranteed data availability for a particular creator.

| Dimension | What to pull | Search the catalog for | Confirm in `inspect` or source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Product and seed context | Product audience, use cases, seed topics and formats | `webpage scrape markdown`, `youtube channel details` | Supplied URL/handle support, accessible text, freshness |
| Candidate discovery | Channel IDs and authors of relevant videos | `youtube search channels`, `youtube search videos keywords` | Global versus in-channel search, result type, pagination, region and language semantics |
| Similar creators | Related channels or topic-based candidates | `youtube similar channels`, `youtube related videos` | Whether results are channels or videos, seed identifier, similarity meaning; related videos alone do not prove creator fit |
| Channel identity | Stable ID, canonical URL, description, subscribers, links | `youtube channel profile`, `youtube channel id` | Required handle versus ID, hidden counts, country field meaning, public contact inclusion |
| Recent performance | Ordered uploads, dates, format, views | `youtube channel videos`, `youtube video statistics` | Sorting, pagination, Shorts/live distinction, per-video fields, sample caps |
| Content and audience fit | Relevant examples, language, available audience geography | `youtube video transcript`, `creator audience demographics` | Transcript coverage; creator country versus viewer country; measured versus estimated audience data |
| Public business contact | Description email, linked contact or agency page | Already retrieved content and available free public-page tools | Explicit channel association, publication source, access limitations; do not repeat a paid lookup |
| Missing business contact | Creator or agency email for an identified channel | `youtube creator business email`, `creator contact enrichment` | Accepted identifiers, attribution, per-result versus per-call charging, empty results, batch limits |
